# Object Tracking with OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script for object tracking using OpenCV's legacy object tracking algorithms. The script allows you to select regions of interest (ROI) in a video and track objects using various tracking algorithms.

- Supports multiple tracking algorithms: CSRT, KCF, Boosting, MIL, TLD, MedianFlow, and MOSSE.
- Real-time object tracking using OpenCV.
- Interactive ROI selection using the `cv2.selectROI()` function.
- Displays tracking status and the success of tracking in real time.
